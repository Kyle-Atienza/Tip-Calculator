## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS pre-processor

### What I learned

This is the first time that i had used the mobile first approach and really had made the workflow on making the website much easier. 

### Continued development

I have my website fully functioning but i think there are still a lot to improve especially on refactoring the code for the javascript as I think it can be more simplified and be more cleaned the wau it was written

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - CSS Tricks is always my first approach to help me remember the basics of CSS Layouts like Grid and Flexbox as i often almost forget the fundamentals 
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - All Webdev related things W3Schools always got me covered
